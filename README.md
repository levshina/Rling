# Rling
This repository contains different version of Rling, the companion R package for "How to Do Linguistics with R". The version 1.0 is the one recommended. 
To install it, you can use the following code (don't forget to modify the path to the file in your local directory):

install.packages("Your/Path/Rling_1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

In case this doesn't work, please try the one in the directory 3.6.1. If all fails, please contact the author or download the file Rling_workspace.RData, which contains all datasets and functions.
